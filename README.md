ðŸ“¦ Olist E-Commerce Store Analysis (Excel | Power BI | Tableau)

This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of the Olist e-commerce dataset using three tools: Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Each dashboard uncovers key business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and shipping efficiency.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Excel: For pivot analysis, KPI summary, and correlation insights.

Power BI: Interactive dashboard with drill-down features across product categories, geographies, and time.

Tableau: Engaging visual storytelling with filters, heatmaps, and dynamic visuals.

ðŸ“Œ Key Metrics & Highlights
Over 44,000â€“48,000 orders received a perfect review score of 5, mostly paid via credit card.

Average delivery time for Pet Shop category hovered around 11 days, reflecting one of the slower categories.

Sales and profits showed steady growth:

Excel reported â‚¹1.64 million in profits.

Power BI revealed â‚¹7 million in total sales for 2018.

Tableau visualized consistent top sales in states like SÃ£o Paulo.

ðŸ“Š Visual Insights & Interpretations
ðŸ§  Customer Behavior
Most purchases (~73% to 78%) happened on weekdays, showing stronger business days.

Top-performing product categories included household utilities, beauty & health, and electronics.

SÃ£o Paulo consistently ranked as the highest-paying city with the greatest order volume and average spend per customer.

ðŸšš Shipping & Review Patterns
There's a strong negative correlation between average delivery days and review scores:

Longer delivery (~20 days) = Poor reviews (score 1).

Faster delivery (~8â€“11 days) = Excellent reviews (score 5).

This insight reinforces the impact of efficient logistics on customer satisfaction.

ðŸ’³ Payment Preferences
Credit cards dominated as the preferred payment method (used in ~78% of orders).

Tableau provided deeper breakdowns, showing usage of boleto (20%), debit, and voucher payments.

ðŸ“ˆ Sales & Seller Trends
Power BI identified top sellers with over 1,400â€“1,800 orders.

Tableau and Excel emphasized strong year-over-year growth, particularly in 2018.

Excel also included a correlation matrix showing positive associations between price, payment, and review score.

âœ… Summary
All dashboards consistently highlight that:

Fast shipping leads to higher customer satisfaction.

Weekdays drive more sales.

Credit card is the most preferred payment method.

SÃ£o Paulo is the most active and profitable region.

Categories like household goods and personal care lead in volume and revenue.
